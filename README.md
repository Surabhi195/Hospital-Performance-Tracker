# Data Analytics Project: Healthcare Data Analysis

This project aims to answer key business questions based on a healthcare dataset. The analysis was performed to uncover insights that can support decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

## ü§î **Questions Addressed**
The following six questions were posed for analysis:

1. **Patient Information** according to Patient_ID.
2. **Billing Information** for various procedures and services.
3. **Bed Occupancy Breakdown** across different departments.
4. **Overall Feedback for Doctors** from patient ratings and surveys.
5. **Diagnosis-wise Stats**, showing trends and common diagnoses.
6. **Billing Amount vs Insurance Amount** for various treatments.

## üí° **Solutions & Approach**
The project was carried out in the following steps:

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - **Data Import**: Raw data was imported from the server into Google Sheets for cleaning and preliminary analysis.
   - **Data Cleaning**:
     - Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
     - Filled in missing values to maintain data completeness.
     - Sorted and trimmed the data for consistency.

### 2. **Data Transformation & Dashboard Creation**
   - After cleaning, the dataset was uploaded to **Power BI** for data visualization.
   - **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** were created for each of the six business questions to provide actionable insights.
   - A **Date Range column** was added to the dashboard to filter and analyze data over time.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboard Features**
   - **Interactive visuals** for answering the six key questions.
   - **Filters** for analyzing data by different categories, such as time, patient ID, diagnosis, and billing information.
   - **Data insights** to assist in making informed decisions based on the analysis.
